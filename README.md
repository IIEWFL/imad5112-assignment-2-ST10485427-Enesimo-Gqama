The purpose of the app: 
The objective of this app is to test users' broad knowledge of historical facts from different eras and continents in order to determine how well they know history. This app includes questions from several centuries to determine whether users are aware of their country's history and well-being, as well as the history of other countries throughout the world.  

The design considerations: 
This app includes four xmlÂ pages, including the welcome page, which contains the app's headline, welcome message, and description. The second page has the quiz portion with the questions, the third page is the scoring page, which shows users how many points they received, and the last page is the review page, which displays all of the questions along with the correct answers. First and foremost, all of these xml pages feature a drawable background with colourful question symbols to signify that this is a quiz app. The first xml page is the welcome page, which contains of the welcome message to users and the program description, as well as two buttons: start and exit. The start button launches the quiz app and navigates to the next segment, whilst the exit button exits the app. In addition, the quiz page consists of two text views, one for the questions to appear and one for determining whether the answer is correct or incorrect. The other section consists of three buttons: true or false, and the next button. The objective of the true or false buttons is to answer the question of whether it is either true or false simply by selecting one of the buttons, and then the response will appear below to show individuals whether the button they selected was correct or incorrect. The next button's purpose is to take users to the next page, where they may check their score.
